
FastAPI Environment Set up:

1. To install FastAPI (preferably in a virtual environment), use pip installer.
FastAPI depends on Starlette and Pydantic libraries, hence they also get installed.

2. Installing Uvicorn using PIP 
To run FastAPI app, you need an ASGI server called uvicorn, so install the same too, using pip installer. 
It will also install uvicornâ€™s dependencies - asgiref, click, h11, and typing-extensions

3. Save the the code as main.py

Commands:

--> pip3 install fastapi
--> pip3 install uvicorn

** Sample code : main.py

from fastapi import FastAPI
app = FastAPI()
@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello World"}

command to run this file:

--> uvicorn main:app --reload

Expected Output :

INFO: Started reloader process [28720]
